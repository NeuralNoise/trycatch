Description: first class try catch semantics for Perl
 TryCatch aims to provide a nicer syntax and method to catch errors in
 Perl, similar to what is found in other languages (such as Java, Python
 or C++). The standard method of using "eval {}; if ($@) {}" is often
 prone to subtle bugs, primarily that its far too easy to stomp on the
 error in error handlers. And also eval/if isn't the nicest idiom.
